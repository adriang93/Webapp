The viewState hidden value in the pages
---------------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly how the state is created, but in
the later JSF implementations it is often Base64 encoded and also
compressed. The view state can be stored either on the server (in which
case all that's sent to the client is a view ID) or all of it is sent to
the client. You can control this in your web.xml with the
javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD context-param, values either 'server' or
'client'.

If you choose 'client' and look at the source of your page, you'll likely
see one hidden element with the state for each form.

If the request contains a javax.faces.ViewState parameter, which it will
in either case, JSF will know that this is a postback.

The view state, in a nutshell, is everything associated with a page that
you need to reconstruct its state. Basically the values of UIComponents.
For example, the current value of an inputText.

I have no idea where you can get nitty-gritty details, other than the JSF
source.
