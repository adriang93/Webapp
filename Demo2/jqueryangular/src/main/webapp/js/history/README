This shows the HTML5 history API and AJAX

Select index.xhtml > View

NOTE : Must set argument -allow-file-access-from-files for
Chrome to allow loading local files with AJAX. Else run server.

Everything works just fine EXCEPT browser refresh, have to
handle server side (NOT FOUND).

JQuery have problems parsing segments with xml declaration,
leave it out.
