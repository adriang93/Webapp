This is just an illustration how to put authorization in the
request header. I.e. each request carry it's authorization 
(because in REST we shouldn't put anything in the session, REST
should be stateless).
This is **not** the way to do it in any real application, 
must use SSL also see see rest_oauth sample.

Use Http monitor to inspect Headers (authorization). Should see some Base64
encoded data as value.

A few cURL test. Recommended is the Chrome Extension "REST Console"
(use to generate value Authorization header)

# GET 
curl -v http://localhost:8080/rest_auth/webresources/public
curl -v http://localhost:8080/rest_auth/webresources/private

# PUT 
# The base64 of the user:password ,YWRtaW5QcmluY2lwYWw6MTEx, generated by REST Console
# for login adminPrincipal:111
curl -v -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5QcmluY2lwYWw6MTEx" http://localhost:8080/rest_auth/webresources/private --request PUT --data "data=111"
