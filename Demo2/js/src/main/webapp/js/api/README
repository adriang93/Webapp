*** JavaScript API's ***

NOTE: We we'll *NOT* use the native DOM-API (the most important API)
or AJAX API (XmlHttpRequets object = XHR)

Instead we use JQuery or better Angular. 

All DOM/CSS manipulation and AJAX with JQuery.

Advanced Html5 Web applications API's not here

The only API used is the native String, see strings.js

SUMMARY: This is empty
