*** README Security ***

This is the same as the jsf_auth sample but backed by a database
(jdbc realm, NOT file realm)

*** THIS CAN SEVERELY DAMAGE YOUR BRAIN ***
Remember: clean and build, possible restart GlassFish
(exception at login seems to trash all following attempts...??)
Also see Default data below. 

Database Setup
---------------

1. Needs a Derby database "test" (tables created by appl.)

3. A Realm:
Create one using
Admin Console > Configurations > server Config > Security > Realms > New 
Name: authRealm

GlassFish setup
---------------
See folder glassfish

Default data
------------
Must comment out on first run, see DefaultData.java
